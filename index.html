        <h1>TRANSLATOR'S PREFACE</h1>
        <p>
        	Although he is best remembered (if at all) for his ambitious Le confessioni d'un Italiano and despite his short life, Italian patriot Ippolito Nievo (1831-1861) was a prolific writer of many styles and many genres. Before his mysterious disappearance at sea in 1861, Nievo had authored dozens of short stories and articles,  two historical dramas, a collection of political poems, and at least two novels in addition to the aforementioned Le confessioni d'un Italiano.   Nievo's work ranges from the satiric to the patriotic, and just as his oeuvre reflected diversity, so did his life experiences. Nievo wrote for periodicals with the likes of Scapigliati such as Cletto Arrighi, and he also served with Garibaldi on his famous expedition of the Mille in the struggle for Italian Unification. 

        </p>
        <span id="transintro-link"></span>
        <p>
        	Alas, Nievo has suffered the fate of many Italian writers in that his work has ever left the Italophone sphere. Nievo has not been translated in the English speaking world until only recently. In fact, it was not until this year that a complete translation of Le confession d'un Italiano was published. The previous translation of this novel was an abridged translation in 1957, now long out-of-print.
        </p>
        <p>
        	This is considerably odd (if not egregious, according to this scholar of Nievo) given that Nievo's lasting influence and reception in the Italian literary milieu. For example, Calvino cited him as an influence for his novel, Il barone rampante.  
        </p>
        <p>
        	Of course, the Nievo that is canonized and which has become the bane of many a QE list, is the Nievo who wrote Le confessioni d'un Italiano. The man has become, like Dante and his Commedia, synonymous with one work. To read Nievo is to read Le confesisoni d'un Italiano. As a friend of mine put it, "Nievo exists for Master's Exam Lists." 
        </p>
        <p>
        	However, with the translated passages (and with my dissertation) that I would like to present a sort of alternate Nievo, a Nievo beyond Le confessioni d'un Italiano. This is a Nievo who is a wicked satirist who is more Leopardi than Manzoni. 

        </p>
        <p>
        	Storia filosofica dei secoli futuri recounts a future history of humanity, starting with the failings of the Italian Risorgimento and ending with a unified but doomed humanity. This satirical novella is among the last works Nievo wrote and published before his untimely death.

        <h1>INTRODUCTION</h1>

        	<a href="#" data-toggle="popover" data-content="I added the capitalization to give everything more of an archaic feel.">The Science of Analogies</a> have granted to this Earth America and to the sky the planets of Le Verrier. This science resembles those women, born to reign in balls and in theatres, women whose beauty is contested by all, except when all fall in love with them at the first opportunity. Eternal and forever the young heir of Plato, the Science of Analogies with rainbow-colored wings batters down the last barriers to human knowledge, while Experimental Science , <a href="#" data-toggle="popover" data-content="“tabaccona” = someone who uses tobacco excessively? It’s unclear what is meant in the original. ">tobacco-infused</a> contemporary of Galileo, stumbles, despite her glasses, on the pebbles of <a href="#" data-toggle="popover" data-content="The original text reads 'strada postale.'

        <p>
        	I have observed gardeners, having exposed plants to an artificial and premature change of seasons, can bring about an early blooming. The roses blooming in the heat of the greenhouse in the middle of winter relate to their still dormant sisters the history of a year that for them has yet to come. It is hardly inconsequential my patience in observing this.  By now, who cares for roses in the year of <a href="#" data-toggle="popover" data-content="  Solferino and Palestro were two decisive 1859 battles in the struggle for Italian independence. By the way, the battle of Solferino inspired the foundation of the Red Cross and the Geneva Conventions. "> Palestro and of Solferino? </a>  Men resemble plants, plants men. We are all related to one another in the universal act of creation and in the composition of this universal work . Why can we not ascertain with reasoning some anticipation of what is to come? After I consulted Liebig, Schelling, Cagliostro, and Professor Gorini, I undertook the fruitful experiment that I am about to describe. 
        </p>
        <p>
        	I took a half ounce of phosphorous and a dram of <a href="#" data-toggle="popover" data-content="“plutonio” is not plutonium. Commentators on this text interpret this substance as being something meant to evoke “Pluto” or night.">plutonio</a>, two elements which comprise <a href="#" data-toggle="popover" data-content ="The original text reads 'intima semenza umana' or 'intimate human seed'">the essential human seed of generation</a>, I mixed the aforementioned elements thoroughly and I extracted from the resulting mixture (dose) that infinitesimal particle which most likely forms the passive instrument of intelligence. Having diluted this arcane atom in a bottle of permanent black ink and having poured the ink on paper saturated appropriately by means of animal magnetism of will and thought, I produced two shiny/radiant black pages . Here is where the mechanical and delicate part of the experiment began. 
        </p>
        <p>
        	I subjected the paper to the average temperatures of three hundred and sixty-three winters and three hundred and sixty three summers. The miracle happened thusly; the fruit of the thoughts of three future centuries  was obtained with such precision, that I challenge a German critic to find something worth ridiculing. As with a photographic negative, bathed in silver nitrate, some white signs appeared on the blackened paper; then, then some letters could be discerned, above all initials, then one could readily discern entire words. Lastly, there appeared in elegant calligraphy the history that I now transcribe. May that future mind, from whom this magical process had these stolen ideas, pardon me for the theft: thoughts are rarely the cause of happiness, and thus, with this abuse of power, I would hope to have done him an excellent service.
